    <p>I was <em>born in Bengaluru</em> but travelled to <b>South Africa</b> when i was in preschool. I stayed there for around 3 years in Johannesburg. During that time, <b>I loved Dinosaurs</b> and kept reading books and buying toys on Dinosaurs. I also visited the <b>Krugar National Park </b>where i saw many animals including <em>Lions, Cheetah, Giraffes, Hippos,Deer and Rhinos.</em> This is one of my core memories. i also traveled to <b>Durban</b> where there was a museum and many tourist attractions. I also visited the place where Gandhi was thrown off the train in South Africa. There are also many beaches in SA. I also went to <b>watch the FIFA World Cup</b> match.</p>

    <p>I like travelling to new places and the idea of travelling is exciting to me. I like to study new Scientific topics revolving <em>technology, science and economics.</em> My favourite color is <b>blue</b>  (and hence most of my webpage will be revolving around blue...). Apart from this i also like <b>participatng in Hackathons and doing courses</b> whenever I am not occupied with any task. I also spend time coding and have also made few projects on <b>Web Developement</b>.</p>
